Description: Implements variable selection for nonlinear mixed-effects models using the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm. The package supports forced covariates, fixed-effects, and provides S4 classes for model specification, data handling, and results visualization. It also includes plotting and diagnostic tools for convergence and selection criteria. For macOS, compilation of the C++ code requires gfortran >= 14.x (<https://mac.r-project.org/tools/>).
