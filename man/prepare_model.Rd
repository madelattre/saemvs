\title{Prepare a SAEMVS model for estimation}
\usage{
prepare_model(data, model)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class \code{saemvsData} containing the dataset and
covariate information.}

\item{model}{An object of class \code{saemvsModel} describing the model
structure and covariate selection rules.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{saemvsProcessedModel}, suitable for use by
internal SAEMVS algorithms.
}
\description{
Internal method that prepares a user-defined \code{saemvsModel} for use by
the SAEMVS estimation and variable selection algorithms.

This function converts a high-level model specification into a
\code{saemvsProcessedModel} by:
\itemize{
\item resolving parameter names into numeric indices,
\item transforming the model function into a standardized
\code{function(phi, t)} form,
\item encoding forced covariate declarations into a binary support matrix.
}

The resulting support matrix has one row per covariate and one column per
model parameter (\code{phi}). A value of 1 indicates that the covariate is
forced for the corresponding parameter.

This function is not intended to be called directly by users.
