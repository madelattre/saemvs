\title{Print method for objects of class \code{saemvsData}}
\usage{
\S4method{print}{saemvsData}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{saemvsData}.}
}
\description{
This S4 method displays a concise summary of a \code{saemvsData} object,
including:
\itemize{
\item Number of individuals (length of \code{y_series})
\item Observations (\code{y_series}), showing only the first values of
each individual
\item Within-subject repeated factor (\code{t_series}), truncated for
readability
\item Covariates to be selected (\code{x_candidates}), showing a
truncated matrix
\item Covariates forced into the model (\code{x_forced}), if any
}
Long vectors and matrices are truncated to improve readability. The full
data can
be accessed directly via the object's slots.
}
\examples{
# Assume 'data' is a saemvsData object

print(data)
