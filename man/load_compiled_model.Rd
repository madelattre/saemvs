\title{Load a compiled shared object model}
\usage{
load_compiled_model(so_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{so_path}{Character string giving the path to the shared object
(\code{.so}) file to be loaded.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{TRUE} invisibly if the shared object is successfully loaded.
}
\description{
Internal function that dynamically loads a compiled shared object (\code{.so})
file containing a previously compiled model. This provides direct access to
the C++ functions generated by \code{\link{compile_model}}.
}
\details{
This function is a thin wrapper around \code{dyn.load()}, and is intended for
internal use.
It does not check whether the symbols are already loaded or whether the file
was compiled with \code{\link{compile_model}}.

\dontrun{
so_file <- "path/to/compiled_model.so"
