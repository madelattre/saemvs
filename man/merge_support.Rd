\title{Merge fixed and selected covariate supports}
\usage{
merge_support(fixed_support, selected_support, nb_phi_s, nb_phi_ns, perm)
}
\arguments{
\item{fixed_support}{Numeric matrix or NULL. Support for covariates that are
forced in the model. Must not include an intercept.}

\item{selected_support}{Numeric matrix or NULL. Support for covariates
selected by the model. Must not include an intercept.}

\item{nb_phi_s}{Integer. Number of selected parameters (columns) in the
model.}

\item{nb_phi_ns}{Integer. Number of non-selected parameters (columns) in the
model.}

\item{perm}{Integer vector. Permutation to reorder columns of the combined
support matrix.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix combining \code{fixed_support} and \code{selected_support},
reordered by \code{perm}. Returns \code{NULL} if both inputs are empty or NULL.
}
\description{
Internal utility function that merges two covariate support matrices
(fixed and selected) into a single support matrix. The resulting matrix
does \strong{not} include an intercept column, which simplifies subsequent
computations in SAEM algorithms.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Internal function; should \strong{not} be exported.
\item If \code{fixed_support} or \code{selected_support} is empty (NULL or all zeros),
it is ignored in the combination.
\item The output matrix does not contain an intercept column.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
fixed_support <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
selected_support <- matrix(c(0, 1, 1, 0), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
perm <- c(2, 1)
merge_support(fixed_support, selected_support,
  nb_phi_s = 2, nb_phi_ns = 2,
