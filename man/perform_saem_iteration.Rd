\usage{
perform_saem_iteration(
  k,
  config,
  state,
  sa_func,
  m_func,
  mh_update_func,
  backend
)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{Integer. Current iteration index.}

\item{config}{List. Model configuration including design matrices,
hyperparameters, and algorithm settings.}

\item{state}{List. Current state of the SAEM algorithm, containing latent
variables, sufficient statistics, and model parameters (e.g. \code{phi},
\code{beta}, \code{gamma}, \code{alpha}). This object is successively
updated and returned by each step of the iteration.}

\item{sa_func}{Function. Stochastic approximation step function (SA-step) to
update sufficient statistics.}

\item{m_func}{Function. M-step function to update model parameters.}

\item{mh_update_func}{Function. Function used to update the proposal
distributions for the Metropolis–Hastings step. This function is called
at each iteration and must be provided.}

\item{backend}{A list containing the compiled model backend used to evaluate
the likelihood and perform model-specific computations during the
Metropolis, SA, and M-steps.}
}
\value{
Updated \code{state} list after one SAEM iteration.
}
\description{
Executes one iteration of the SAEM algorithm, sequentially performing
the Metropolis simulation step, the stochastic approximation (SA) step,
the M-step, and a Metropolis–Hastings proposal update.
This function acts as a lightweight orchestrator and does not implement
model-specific logic itself; all computations are delegated to the
functions passed as arguments.
