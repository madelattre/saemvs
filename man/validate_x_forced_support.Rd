\title{Validate forced covariate declarations for model parameters}
\usage{
validate_x_forced_support(x, phi_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A named list or \code{NULL}. Each element corresponds to a model
parameter and contains the names of covariates that must be forced for that
parameter.}

\item{phi_names}{Character vector giving the valid model parameter names.}
}
\value{
The validated \code{x_forced_support} object (possibly an empty
list).
}
\description{
Internal validation helper for the \code{x_forced_support} argument of
\code{saemvsModel}. This function checks that forced covariate declarations
are provided as a named list mapping model parameter names to covariate
names.

The function ensures that:
\itemize{
\item the object is either \code{NULL} or a named list,
\item all names correspond to valid model parameters,
\item each list element is a character vector of covariate names.
}

An empty list is allowed and indicates that no covariates are forced in the
model.
