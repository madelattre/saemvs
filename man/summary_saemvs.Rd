\title{Summary of SAEM Variable Selection Results}
\usage{
summary_saemvs(saem_results, digits)

\S4method{summary_saemvs}{saemvsResults,numeric}(saem_results, digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{saem_results}{An object of class \code{saemvsResults} containing
the output of a SAEMVS run.}

\item{digits}{Numeric scalar (default = 3). Number of decimal places to use
when printing coefficients and covariance matrix.}
}
\description{
Provides a human-readable summary of the results from a SAEM variable selection run.
For the best model (chosen by BIC/e-BIC), it displays:
\itemize{
\item Selected covariates for each \eqn{\phi} parameter.
\item Estimated regression coefficients (\eqn{\beta}) with labeled rows
for intercept, forced covariates, and selected covariates.
\item Estimated covariance matrix (\eqn{\Gamma}), where fixed-effect parameters
are zeroed out for clarity.
}
}
\details{
The best model is identified as the one minimizing the selection criterion.
The function separates forced covariates (always included), selected covariates
(chosen by the algorithm), and the intercept. Coefficients are displayed in a
labeled table, followed by the estimated covariance matrix.
