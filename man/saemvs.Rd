\title{Sparse Variable Selection with SAEM}
\usage{
saemvs(data, model, init, tuning_algo, hyperparam, pen)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class \link[=saemvsData-class]{saemvsData}
containing the dataset (observations and design matrices).}

\item{model}{An object of class \link[=saemvsModel-class]{saemvsModel}
specifying the model structure and the indices of parameters
that are candidates for selection (\code{phi_to_select_idx}).}

\item{init}{An object of class \link[=saemvsInit-class]{saemvsInit}
providing the initialization for the SAEM algorithm.}

\item{tuning_algo}{An object of class \link[=saemvsTuning-class]{saemvsTuning}
containing algorithmic tuning parameters such as
the spike grid (\code{spike_values_grid}), number of workers, and random seed.}

\item{hyperparam}{An object of class \link[=saemvsHyperSlab-class]{saemvsHyperSlab}
containing the hyperparameters for the slab prior.}

\item{pen}{Character string indicating the model selection criterion.
Must be either \code{"BIC"} or \code{"e-BIC"}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\linkS4class{{saemvsResults}} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{criterion}: The selection criterion used (\code{"BIC"} or \code{"e-BIC"}).
\item \code{criterion_values}: Values of the criterion for each unique support.
\item \code{thresholds}: Thresholds computed for each spike value.
\item \code{beta_map}: MAP estimates of regression parameters for each spike value.
\item \code{mle_estimates}: MLE estimates for each unique support.
\item \code{support}: List of supports obtained across spike values.
\item \code{unique_support}: List of unique supports identified.
\item \code{support_mapping}: Mapping from each run to the corresponding unique support.
\item \code{spike_values_grid}: The grid of spike variances used.
\item \code{phi_fixed_idx}: Indices of fixed parameters (not subject to selection).
\item \code{forced_variables_idx}: For each unique support, indices of covariates
that were forced into the model (always included).
\item \code{selected_variables_idx}: For each unique support, indices of covariates
that were actively selected by the algorithm (excluding forced ones).
}
}
\description{
The \code{saemvs} function performs stochastic approximation EM (SAEM)
combined with variable selection using a spike-and-slab prior.
It supports both BIC and extended BIC (e-BIC) as model selection criteria.
}
\details{
This method explores a grid of spike variances (\code{nu0}) in parallel,
fits MAP estimates for each candidate support, and then evaluates unique
supports with the chosen information criterion to select the best model.

The procedure is carried out in two steps:
\enumerate{
\item For each spike variance candidate (\code{nu0}), a MAP estimation
is performed in parallel, producing supports, thresholds, and MAP estimates.
\item Unique supports are identified, and each support is re-evaluated
with the chosen information criterion (\code{pen}) to select the most
appropriate model.
}

Parallel execution is handled using the \code{future} and \code{furrr} packages.
The model function (C++ code) must be compiled on each worker before execution.
