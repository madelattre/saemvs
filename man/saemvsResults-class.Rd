\title{Class saemvsResults}
\description{
Results of SAEMVS model selection.
}
\details{
Internal results container storing all outputs from a SAEMVS grid search and
model selection procedure. Objects of this class are created automatically
by the SAEMVS algorithm and are not intended to be constructed manually.

The class is mainly used as an internal result structure and is returned by
functions implementing SAEMVS. Downstream methods such as
\code{\link{summary_saemvs}} make use of these slots for reporting.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{criterion}}{Character scalar. The selection criterion used to identify
the best model. Supported values: \code{"BIC"} or \code{"e-BIC"}.}

\item{\code{criterion_values}}{Numeric vector. Values of the selection criterion
computed for each unique support in \code{unique_support}.}

\item{\code{thresholds}}{List. Thresholds applied to beta coefficients for each
spike parameter value in \code{spike_values_grid}.}

\item{\code{beta_map}}{List. MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimates of beta
coefficients for each spike value.}

\item{\code{mle_estimates}}{List. Maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters
(beta and gamma) computed on each unique support.}

\item{\code{support}}{List. Raw supports selected across the spike grid
(may contain duplicates).}

\item{\code{unique_support}}{List. Unique supports obtained from \code{support}
(duplicates removed). Each entry corresponds to one element of
\code{criterion_values}.}

\item{\code{support_mapping}}{Numeric vector. For each element of \code{support},
gives the index of the corresponding entry in \code{unique_support}.}

\item{\code{spike_values_grid}}{Numeric vector. The grid of spike parameter values
explored during the SAEMVS run.}

\item{\code{phi_fixed_idx}}{Numeric vector or \code{NULL}. Indices of fixed
\eqn{\phi} components (non-estimated parameters), used for display in
summaries.}

\item{\code{forced_variables_idx}}{List. For each unique support, indices of
covariates that were forced into the model (always included).}

\item{\code{selected_variables_idx}}{List. For each unique support, indices of
covariates that were selected by the variable selection procedure
(excluding forced covariates).}
