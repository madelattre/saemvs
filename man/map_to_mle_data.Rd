\title{Transform data object from MAP to MLE representation}
\usage{
map_to_mle_data(data, cand_support)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class \code{saemvsData}, containing the response
vector, time series, forced covariates, and candidate covariates.}

\item{cand_support}{A binary matrix of dimension \code{(p + 1) x q}, where:
\itemize{
\item The first row corresponds to the intercept and must contain only ones.
\item The following \code{p} rows correspond to the candidate covariates
in \code{data@x_candidates}.
\item Each column corresponds to one parameter.
\item An entry equal to 1 indicates inclusion of the covariate in the support.
}}
}
\value{
A new object of class \code{saemvsData}, with updated forced covariates
that include both the original forced covariates and the subset of active
candidate covariates.
}
\description{
Internal method that restructures a \code{saemvsData} object when moving
from a MAP (maximum a posteriori) representation to an MLE (maximum likelihood
estimation) representation.
}
\details{
The function selects only the candidate covariates that are active in the
support matrix, and appends them to the forced covariates. The resulting
dataset is compatible with an MLE-based model fit.

Robustness checks are performed to ensure:
\itemize{
\item The number of rows in \code{cand_support} matches
\code{ncol(data@x_candidates) + 1}.
\item The first row of \code{cand_support} (intercept) contains only ones.
}
