\title{Compute threshold for spike-and-slab prior}
\usage{
threshold(nu1, nu0, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{nu1}{Numeric. Variance of the "slab" component (large variance).}

\item{nu0}{Numeric. Variance of the "spike" component (small variance).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Prior inclusion probability of the variable.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Threshold value used in spike-and-slab selection.
}
\description{
Computes the threshold value for variable selection with the Gaussian
spike-and-slab prior, based on prior variances and inclusion probability.
