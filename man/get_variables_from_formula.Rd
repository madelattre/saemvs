\title{Extract variables and special declarations from a model formula}
\usage{
get_variables_from_formula(f)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A model formula specifying the response, covariates, and special
terms \code{group()} and \code{repeated()}.}
}
\value{
A named list with components:
\describe{
\item{y}{Character scalar giving the response variable name.}
\item{id}{Character scalar giving the subject/group identifier, or
\code{NULL} if not specified.}
\item{t}{Character scalar giving the time variable, or \code{NULL} if not
specified.}
\item{forced}{Character vector of covariates explicitly included in the
formula, or \code{NULL}.}
\item{excluded}{Character vector of covariates explicitly excluded via
subtraction, or \code{NULL}.}
}
}
\description{
Internal utility that parses a model formula used in \code{saemvsData}
construction. The formula is expected to follow an extended syntax of the
form:
\preformatted{
  y ~ . + repeated(time) + group(id)
}

In addition to the standard response and covariates, this function extracts:
\itemize{
\item the response variable,
\item the grouping (subject) variable via \code{group()},
\item the repeated-measure (time) variable via \code{repeated()},
\item covariates explicitly included or excluded in the formula.
}

The dot (\code{.}) is detected but not expanded at this stage, as its
resolution requires access to the data. Expansion is deferred to the data
preprocessing stage.
