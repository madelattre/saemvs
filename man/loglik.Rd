\title{Compute log-likelihood (or penalized log-likelihood) for a SAEMVS model}
\usage{
loglik(
  data,
  model,
  tuning_algo,
  param,
  pen,
  p,
  phi_to_select_idx,
  nb_forced_beta
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{saemvsData} object containing the response and design
matrices.}

\item{model}{A \code{saemvsModel} object defining the model structure.}

\item{tuning_algo}{A \code{saemvsTuning} object containing tuning settings
(e.g., number of Monte Carlo samples).}

\item{param}{A list with parameter estimates. Must contain:
\describe{
\item{beta}{Matrix of fixed-effect coefficients.}
\item{gamma}{Covariance matrix of random effects.}
\item{sigma2}{Residual variance.}
}}

\item{pen}{Character string specifying the penalty. One of "BIC", "e-BIC",
or no penalty.}

\item{p}{Numeric, number of candidate covariates (for e-BIC computation).
Consider renaming to \code{num_covariates} for clarity.}

\item{phi_to_select_idx}{Integer vector indicating which covariates
(columns of the design matrix) are subject to selection. Used for computing
the penalization term in BIC/e-BIC.}

\item{nb_forced_beta}{Integer specifying the number of covariates that are
forced to be included in the model. This is used to adjust the penalization
term in the e-BIC computation.}
}
\value{
Numeric value of the penalized log-likelihood (BIC or e-BIC).
}
\description{
This internal function computes the (penalized) log-likelihood of the data
given the model and parameter estimates. The method supports different
penalty types including "BIC" and "e-BIC".
