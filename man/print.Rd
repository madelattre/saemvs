\value{
The function prints a summary to the console invisibly. It returns
the input
object invisibly (typical behavior for \code{print()} methods).

Invisibly returns the input \code{x} object. The main purpose is
side-effect printing.

\description{
This S4 method displays a concise summary of a \code{saemvsData} object,
including:
\itemize{
\item Number of individuals (length of \code{y_series})
\item Observations (\code{y_series}), showing only the first values of
each individual
\item Within-subject repeated factor (\code{t_series}), truncated for
readability
\item Covariates to be selected (\code{x_candidates}), showing a
truncated matrix
\item Covariates forced into the model (\code{x_forced}), if any
}
Long vectors and matrices are truncated to improve readability. The full
data can
be accessed directly via the object's slots.

This S4 method displays a concise summary of a \code{saemvsModel} object.
It prints the model function, the parameter names, parameters subject to
selection, non-random parameters, and any support for forced included
covariates.
Vectors are printed on a single line, truncated when necessary for
readability.
The print method is intended for interactive display and provides a quick
overview of the model structure and associated parameters. It does not
modify the object.

Displays a concise summary of a \code{saemvsHyperSlab} object, including the
prior distributions for model parameters. The output shows:
\itemize{
\item The slab parameter controlling the prior variance of covariate
coefficients
\item Covariance of parameters subject to selection, assumed to follow an
inverse Wishart prior
\item Residual variance, assumed to follow an inverse Gamma prior (with
parametrization
shape = residual_variance_prior_shape / 2 and
rate = residual_variance_prior_shape * residual_variance_prior_rate / 2)
\item Prior variance for the intercept parameter
}
Matrices and vectors are formatted for readability.

Displays the initial values used by the SAEM-VS algorithm. The output
provides a structured overview of the starting values for model parameters,
including:
\itemize{
\item The intercept parameter
\item Regression coefficients for forced covariates
\item Regression coefficients for covariates subject to selection
\item Covariance matrix of the random effects
\item Residual variance
\item Indicator specifying whether default initialisation was used for
covariate coefficients
}

Displays the tuning parameters used by the SAEM-VS algorithm. The output
provides a structured overview of algorithmic settings, including:
\itemize{
\item SAEM iteration and burn-in parameters
\item Metropolis-Hastings settings used in the stochastic approximation
step
\item Spike-and-slab hyperparameter grid
\item Importance sampling settings for log-likelihood computation
\item Reproducibility and parallelisation options
}

Displays a concise overview of the results from a SAEM variable selection
procedure. The output provides high-level information about the model
selection process and identifies the best model according to the chosen
selection criterion.
}
\details{
Matrices are formatted for readability and truncated when necessary.
Column names corresponding to model parameters are prefixed with \code{phi}
when displayed.

The spike values grid is fully displayed, while other parameters are shown
as scalar values for clarity.

The printed summary includes:
\itemize{
\item The selection criterion used (BIC or e-BIC).
\item The number of spike parameter values explored.
\item The number of candidate supports evaluated.
\item The number of unique supports retained after removing duplicates.
\item The criterion value of the best selected model.
\item The number of covariates selected in the best model.
}
