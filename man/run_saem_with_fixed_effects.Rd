\description{
Executes the SAEM algorithm for models with both random and fixed effects.
Shrinkage is applied to the covariance of fixed parameters after burn-in
iterations.
}
\details{
In this context, "fixed effects" refers to parameters that are not subject
to variable selection and whose random-effect covariance matrix is
progressively shrunk after the burn-in phase. These parameters are not
fixed to constant values, but their variability is reduced over iterations.
After the burn-in phase, shrinkage is progressively applied to the
covariance matrix of the fixed-effect parameters. Shrinkage coefficients
are computed from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix at the
end of burn-in and are applied multiplicatively at each subsequent
iteration via \code{shrink_covariance_matrix}.
