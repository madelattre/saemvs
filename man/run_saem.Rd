\title{Run the SAEM algorithm}
\usage{
run_saem(data, model, init, tuning_algo, hyperparam, backend)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class \code{saemvsProcessedData} containing the
observed data, design matrices, and related metadata.}

\item{model}{An object of class \code{saemvsProcessedModel} specifying the
model structure, covariates, random effects, and indices of parameters
subject or not subject to selection.}

\item{init}{An object of class \code{saemvsProcessedInit} providing
initialization for the algorithm (parameters, variances, latent states,
etc.).}

\item{tuning_algo}{An object of class \code{saemvsTuning} defining
algorithmic
parameters such as number of iterations, burn-in period, step-size
sequence, and parallelization settings.}

\item{hyperparam}{An object of class \code{saemvsHyperSpikeAndSlab}
containing hyperparameters for the spike-and-slab prior or other priors used
for variable selection.}

\item{backend}{A list of compiled model functions and helper routines, used
internally for fast computation during SAEM-MCMC iterations.}
}
\value{
A \code{state} list containing the results of the SAEM iterations,
including:
\itemize{
\item \code{phi}: latent parameter matrices per iteration.
\item \code{beta_to_select}, \code{beta_not_to_select}: regression
coefficients.
\item \code{gamma_to_select}, \code{gamma_not_to_select}: covariance
matrices.
\item \code{alpha}: posterior inclusion probabilities for parameters to
select.
\item \code{sigma2}: residual variance per iteration.
\item Stochastic approximation statistics (s1, s2, s3) used internally.
}
}
\description{
Internal generic method for executing the Stochastic Approximation
Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm in the context of variable
selection with spike-and-slab priors or maximum likelihood estimation.
}
\details{
This method orchestrates the full SAEM procedure, including:
\itemize{
\item Validation and preprocessing of input data and model.
\item Initialization of algorithmic state.
\item Configuration of hyperparameters and tuning parameters.
\item Selection of appropriate stochastic approximation (SA) and
maximization (M) steps depending on the model type and presence of
fixed effects.
\item Iterative execution of the SAEM algorithm until convergence.
}

Depending on the configuration of the model, hyperparameters, and presence of
fixed effects,
the function selects the appropriate SA and M-step implementations:
\itemize{
\item \code{"map_full_select"}: MAP estimation with all parameters
subject to selection.
\item \code{"map_part_select_nofixed"}: MAP with partial selection,
no fixed parameters.
\item \code{"map_part_select_fixed"}: MAP with partial selection and
fixed parameters.
\item \code{"mle_nofixed"}: Maximum Likelihood Estimation with no fixed
parameters.
\item \code{"mle_fixed"}: Maximum Likelihood Estimation with fixed
parameters.
}
}
\note{
This method is internal to the package and should not be called
directly by end-users.
High-level functions (e.g., \code{saemvs}) provide the proper interface
for running the algorithm.
