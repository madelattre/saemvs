\title{Run the SAEM algorithm}
\usage{
run_saem(data, model, init, tuning_algo, hyperparam)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class \code{saemvsData}.
Contains the observed data and related metadata.}

\item{model}{An object of class \code{saemvsModel}.
Describes the statistical model, including covariates and random effect
structure.}

\item{init}{An object of class \code{saemvsInit}.
Contains initialization values for the algorithm (parameters, variances,
etc.).}

\item{tuning_algo}{An object of class \code{saemvsTuning}.
Defines algorithmic tuning parameters (number of iterations, burn-in,
decay rates, etc.).}

\item{hyperparam}{An object of class \code{saemvsHyperSpikeAndSlab}.
Hyperparameters for the spike-and-slab prior used in variable selection.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{state} object containing the results of the SAEM
iterations, including parameter estimates, variances, and posterior inclusion
probabilities.
}
\description{
Internal generic method for running the Stochastic Approximation
Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm in the context of variable
selection with spike-and-slab priors or maximum likelihood estimation.
}
\details{
This method orchestrates the full SAEM procedure, including:
\itemize{
\item Data validation and preprocessing
\item Initialization of algorithmic state
\item Configuration of hyperparameters and tuning parameters
\item Selection of appropriate stochastic approximation (SA) and
maximization (M) steps depending on the model type and presence of fixed
effects
\item Iterative execution of the SAEM algorithm until convergence
}

The function is dispatched on specific classes of data, model,
initialization, tuning, and hyperparameter objects, and should not be called
directly by the end-user.

Depending on the configuration of the model and hyperparameters, the function
automatically selects the appropriate SA and M step implementations:
\itemize{
\item \code{"map_full_select"}: MAP estimation with all parameters subject
to selection.
\item \code{"map_part_select_nofixed"}: MAP with partial selection and no
fixed parameters.
\item \code{"map_part_select_fixed"}: MAP with partial selection and some
fixed parameters.
\item \code{"mle_nofixed"}: MLE with no fixed parameters.
\item \code{"mle_fixed"}: MLE with some fixed parameters.
}
}
\note{
This method is internal to the package and not intended to be called
directly by end-users. Instead, high-level user functions should be used to
set up and run the algorithm.
